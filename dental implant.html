                <p>Dental implant surgery is a procedure that replaces tooth roots with metal, screwlike posts and
                    replaces
                    damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function much like real ones. Dental
                    implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that doesn't fit well and
                    can
                    offer an option when a lack of natural teeth roots don't allow building denture or bridgework tooth
                    replacements.</p>

                <p>How dental implant surgery is performed depends on the type of implant and the condition of your
                    jawbone.
                    Dental implant surgery may involve several procedures. The major benefit of implants is solid
                    support
                    for your new teeth — a process that requires the bone to heal tightly around the implant. Because
                    this
                    bone healing requires time, the process can take many months.</p>

            <h2>Why its done</h2>
            <p>Dental implants are surgically placed in your jawbone, where they serve as the roots of missing teeth.
                Because the titanium in the implants fuses with your jawbone, the implants won't slip, make noise or
                cause
                bone damage the way fixed bridgework or dentures might. And the materials can't decay like your own
                teeth
                that support regular bridgework can.</p>
            <p>In general, dental implants may be right for you if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have one or more missing teeth</li>
                <li>Have a jawbone that's reached full growth</li>
                <li>Have adequate bone to secure the implants or are able to have a bone graft</li>
                <li>Have healthy oral tissues</li>
                <li>Don't have health conditions that will affect bone healing</li>
                <li>Are unable or unwilling to wear dentures</li>
                <li>Want to improve your speech</li>
                <li>Are willing to commit several months to the process</li>
                <li>Don't smoke tobacco</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What can you expect</h2>
            <p>Dental implant surgery is usually an outpatient surgery performed in stages, with healing time between
                procedures. The process of placing a dental implant involves multiple steps, including:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Damaged tooth removal</li>
                <li>Jawbone preparation (grafting), when needed</li>
                <li>Dental implant placement</li>
                <li>Bone growth and healing</li>
                <li>Abutment placement</li>
                <li>Artificial tooth placement</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The entire process can take many months from start to finish. Much of that time is devoted to healing and
                waiting for the growth of new bone in your jaw. Depending on your situation, the specific procedure done
                or
                the materials used, certain steps can sometimes be combined.</p>
       
        </div>
     <h2>When bone grafting is required</h2>
        <div class="types-container">
            <div class="types-item1">
                <p>If your jawbone isn't thick enough or is too soft, you may need bone grafting before you can have
                    dental
                    implant surgery. That's because the powerful chewing action of your mouth exerts great pressure on
                    your
                    bone, and if it can't support the implant, the surgery likely would fail. A bone graft can create a
                    more
                    solid base for the implant.</p>
                <p>There are several bone graft materials that can be used to rebuild a jawbone. Options may include a
                    natural
                    bone graft, such as from another location in your body, or a synthetic bone graft, such as
                    bone-substitute
                    material that can provide support structures for new bone growth. Talk to your doctor about options
                    that
                    will work best for you.</p>
                <p>It may take several months for the transplanted bone to grow enough new bone to support a dental
                    implant. In
                    some cases, you may need only minor bone grafting, which can be done at the same time as the implant
                    surgery. The condition of your jawbone determines how you proceed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="types-item2">
                <img src="./bone gragting.webp" alt="" width="100%">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="treatment">
            <h2>Placing the dental implant</h2>
            <p>During surgery to place the dental implant, your oral surgeon makes a cut to open your gum and expose the
                bone. Holes are drilled into the bone where the dental implant metal post will be placed. Since the post
                will serve as the tooth root, it's implanted deep into the bone.
            </p>
            <p>At this point, you'll still have a gap where your tooth is missing. A type of partial, temporary denture
                can
                be placed for appearance, if needed. You can remove this denture for cleaning and while you sleep.
            </p>
            <h2>Waiting for bone growth</h2>
            <p>Once the metal implant post is placed in your jawbone, osseointegration (oss-ee-oh-in-tuh-GRAY-shun)
                begins.
                During this process, the jawbone grows into and unites with the surface of the dental implant. This
                process,
                which can take several months, helps provide a solid base for your new artificial tooth — just as roots
                do
                for your natural teeth.</p>
            <h2>Placing the abutment</h2>
            <p>When osseointegration is complete, you may need additional surgery to place the abutment — the piece
                where
                the crown will eventually attach. This minor surgery is typically done with local anesthesia in an
                outpatient setting.</p>
            <p>To place the abutment:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your oral surgeon reopens your gum to expose the dental implant</li>
                <li>The abutment is attached to the dental implant</li>
                <li>The gum tissue is then closed around, but not over, the abutment</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In some cases, the abutment is attached to the dental implant metal post when the post is implanted. That
                means you won't need an extra surgical step. Because the abutment juts past the gumline, however, it's
                visible when you open your mouth — and it will be that way until your dentist completes the tooth
                prosthesis. Some people don't like that appearance and prefer to have the abutment placed in a separate
                procedure.</p>
            <p>After the abutment is placed, your gums must heal for about two weeks before the artificial tooth can be
                attached.</p>
            <h2>Choosing your new artificial teeth</h2>
            <p>Once your gums heal, you'll have more impressions made of your mouth and remaining teeth. These
                impressions
                are used to make the crown — your realistic-looking artificial tooth. The crown can't be placed until
                your
                jawbone is strong enough to support use of the new tooth.</p>
            <h2>After the procedure</h2>
            <p>Whether you have dental implant surgery in one stage or multiple stages, you may experience some of the
                typical discomforts associated with any type of dental surgery, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Swelling of your gums and face</li>
                <li>Bruising of your skin and gums</li>
                <li>Pain at the implant site</li>
                <li>Minor bleeding</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You may need pain medications or antibiotics after dental implant surgery. If swelling, discomfort or any
                other problem gets worse in the days after surgery, contact your oral surgeon.</p>
            <p>After each stage of surgery, you may need to eat soft foods while the surgical site heals. Typically,
                your
                surgeon will use stitches that dissolve on their own. If your stitches aren't self-dissolving, your
                doctor
                removes them.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Most dental implants are successful. Sometimes, however, the bone fails to fuse sufficiently to the metal
                implant. Smoking, for example, may contribute to implant failure and complications.</p>
            <p>If the bone fails to fuse sufficiently, the implant is removed, the bone is cleaned up, and you can try
                the
                procedure again in about three months.</p>
            <p>You can help your dental work — and remaining natural teeth — last longer if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Practice excellent oral hygiene.</b> Just as with your natural teeth, keep implants, artificial
                    teeth
                    and gum tissue clean. Specially designed brushes, such as an interdental brush that slides between
                    teeth, can help clean the nooks and crannies around teeth, gums and metal posts.</li>

                <li><b>See your dentist regularly. </b>Schedule dental checkups to ensure the health and proper
                    functioning
                    of your implants and follow the advice for professional cleanings.</li>
                <li><b>Avoid damaging habits. </b>Don't chew hard items, such as ice and hard candy, which can break
                    your
                    crowns — or your natural teeth. Avoid tooth-staining tobacco and caffeine products. Get treatment if
                    you
                    grind your teeth.</li>
